# Sentence-Sentiment-Classification-using-DistilBERT
This repository uses DistilBERT for Sentence Sentiment Classification with improved results than BERT


We will use pre-trained deep learning model to process some text. We will then use the output of that model to classify the text. The text is a list of sentences from film reviews. And we will calssify each sentence as either speaking "positively" about its subject of "negatively".
